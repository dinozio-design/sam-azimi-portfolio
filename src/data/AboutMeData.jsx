        description: "In high school, I harbored a strong inclination toward engineering. During my senior year, I secured a co-op placement at an engineering firm where I honed my skills in AutoCAD and drafting electrical installation drawings. Impressed with my work ethic, they hired me for the summer after graduation. Seeking guidance from my manager, I inquired about choosing an engineering discipline. His advice, emphasizing the importance of pairing engineering with business knowledge, resonated with me. Taking his counsel, I enrolled in McMaster University's Engineering and Management program, a challenging path blending technical engineering, finance, accounting, project management, business strategy, marketing, and administration. Although unconventional, this unique combination provided a holistic education. Grateful for the mentorship of my first engineering manager, Norm Fisher, I reflect on the invaluable advice that shaped my educational journey at McMaster University."
