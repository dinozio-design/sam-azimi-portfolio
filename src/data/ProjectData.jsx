        description: "This app is a great example of an Object Oriented JavaScript. Instead of using RegEx, I hardcoded every scenario (future refactoring is on the todo list to simplify the code with RegEx. It is in the que!). I used the window.prompt method to open the dialogue box and collect the userResponse for variety of options to generate a strong password. Nowadays every website or app has it's own requirements for a strong password that varries from lenght to Upper/Lowercase and alphanumeric or special characters. This app allows the user to chose any of the necessary requirements for a strong password. After the password is generated, the user then is able to copy the string and paste it to their own password keeper.",
